Collection of scripts to process the raw data from the SOPi microscope into
a useful format.

Note that the code in this repository does not generalize well and has
many hardcoded settings for the microscopes used. A more generalizable
analysis pipeline is currently being constructed.

Output files follow the v0.2 draft of the OME-ZARR specification.
